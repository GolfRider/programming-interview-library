# ALGO

Repository implementing lots of algorithms commonly used in programming interviews.

If you can imagine being able to use this as an existing library in a programming interview (a stretch), the idea is that this library contains a litany of different things you only ever need to attempt in such a situation.

As such, it's mostly pointless, but you may be interested in specific algorithms. These include generalized versions of:

- Getting all permutations of a string
- Longest common subsequence
- Longest increasing subsequence
- Creation of a prime sieve
- Computing factorial
- Reversing a number
- Max intervals that can overlap
- Number of ways to reach a goal
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Converting to and from Roman Numerals
- Levenshtein (edit) distance between two strings
- Matrix search algorithm
- Counting and quicksort implementations
- Heap-based median finding solution
- Check if a list is a palindrome
-
