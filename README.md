# Library of Programming Interview Algorithms

Java solutions to algorithms commonly used in programming interviews.

### Motivation

While I was revising for programming interviews I thought it would be more interesting to package solutions into a utility library. Consider it the library that programmers would want to use in an interview situation, if such a thing were ever allowed.

### Algorithms Included
The library currently includes generalized versions of:

#### Strings
- Getting all permutations of a string
- Levenshtein (edit) distance between two strings

#### Arrays
- Longest common subsequence
- Longest increasing subsequence
- Max intervals that can overlap
- Number of ways to reach a goal
- Matrix search algorithm

#### Graphs
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

#### Lists
- Check if a list is a palindrome

#### Math
- Creation of a prime sieve
- Computing factorial
- Reversing a number

#### Sorting / Search
- Counting and quicksort implementations
- Heap-based median finding solution

#### General
- Converting to and from Roman Numerals
